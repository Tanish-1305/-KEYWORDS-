CPU:
The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It's responsible for executing instructions from programs and performing calculations. Essentially, it processes the data and instructions necessary to run software and manage hardware.

GPU:
Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor primarily designed to handle and accelerate graphical computations. While it was initially developed to render images and video on screens, modern GPUs have evolved into highly versatile processors used for a wide range of computational tasks.

NETWORK:
Networking involves the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. This can include everything from local networks within a home or office to vast global networks like the Internet.
image
NETWORK TYPES:

LAN (Local Area Network): A network covering a small geographical area, like a home or office. It’s typically used to connect devices like computers, printers, and smartphones within a single location.
WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that spans a large geographical area, such as cities, countries, or even continents. The Internet is the largest WAN.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): A network that covers a city or large campus. It’s larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.
PAN (Personal Area Network): A network for personal devices within a very short range, like connecting a smartphone to a laptop via Bluetooth.



INTERNET:
The Internet is a vast, global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standard protocols. It allows people and devices to exchange information, access resources, and interact across the world.

image INTERNET PROTOCOLS:

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): The foundational suite of protocols for the Internet. TCP handles data transmission, ensuring packets are delivered correctly and in order, while IP handles addressing and routing.
HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure): Protocols used for transferring web pages and other content. HTTPS includes encryption for secure communication over the Internet.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between computers over the Internet.



7 LAYERS OF OSI MODEL:
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a networking system. It divides the networking process into seven distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities

image Physical Layer: Transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium.
DatPa Link Layer: Error detection and correction, framing, and MAC addressing.
Network Layer: Routing of data packets across networks.
Transport Layer: Reliable data transfer and flow control.
Session Layer: Session management and control.
Presentation Layer: Data translation, encryption, and compression.
Application Layer: Network services to end-user applications.



ASIC:
An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or task, rather than for general-purpose use. Unlike general-purpose processors (like CPUs), which are designed to handle a wide range of tasks, ASICs are tailored to perform a particular function with high efficiency and speed.

CISC:
CISC stands for Complex Instruction Set Computer. It refers to a type of CPU architecture that is designed to execute complex instructions with fewer lines of assembly code, aiming to perform multiple operations in a single instruction.
image


RISC:
RISC, which stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of CPU architecture designed to simplify the processor design by using a smaller, more optimized set of instructions.
image


RISC-V:
RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer – Five) is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) that aims to simplify processor design and enable innovation through its modular and extensible nature.
image


VPN:
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows users to securely connect to the internet by routing their connection through an encrypted tunnel to a remote server.
image


BLOCKCHAIN:
A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger technology that securely records and stores data across a network of computers (or nodes). It is designed to be decentralized, transparent, and tamper-resistant, making it useful for various applications, most notably cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
image


SOC:
SOC stands for Security Operations Center, a centralized unit within an organization that focuses on monitoring, detecting, responding to, and analyzing security incidents and threats in real-time. SOCs are critical for maintaining cybersecurity in an organization by ensuring continuous protection of networks, systems, and data.

image
IMPORTANCE OF SOC:
Real-Time Threat Response: Having a SOC enables organizations to detect and respond to security incidents much faster than they could without one.
Proactive Threat Detection: SOC teams don’t just react to attacks but actively look for vulnerabilities and potential threats to prevent incidents.
Regulatory Compliance: Many industries (finance, healthcare, etc.) are required by law to have strong security practices, and a SOC helps ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and others.



FRONTEND:
Frontend refers to the part of a web application or website that users interact with directly. It involves everything that users see and experience in their browsers, including the layout, design, buttons, text, images, and overall user interface (UI).



API:
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests for information or services should be made between systems, enabling developers to access the functionality of one application from another without needing to understand the underlying code.



BACKEND:
Backend refers to the server-side of a web application or website, responsible for managing the behind-the-scenes functionality that powers the frontend. While users don’t directly interact with the backend, it handles important tasks such as data processing, storage, security, and logic, enabling the frontend to display content and respond to user actions effectively.



VIRTUAL MACHINE:
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system (OS) and applications just like a physical machine. Virtual machines allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, each in its own isolated environment.



SSL:
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol that encrypts and secures data sent between two devices or applications on the internet. It's used to establish trust and authenticate the other party before sharing data or credentials.



FPGA:
Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be programmed and reprogrammed after manufacturing. It's essentially a highly flexible and reusable digital circuit.



ISP:
Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that provides internet access and related services to customers.



DSL:
